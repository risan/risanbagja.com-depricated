# Hi, my name is Risan Bagja Pradana

I’m a web developer with four years professional experience. I’ve been working
on various projects with some of the big brands such as LG, Mitsubishi, and
Samsung.

I'm passionate about coding. I enjoy spending time writing clean, readable, and
well-tested code.

I’m open to any programming languages or frameworks. But I'm most experienced
with Javascript and PHP. Currently, Laravel, Node.js, and React are my favorite
stacks.

I'm from Indonesia but currently resides in Stockholm, Sweden. You can reach me
at [risanbagja@gmail.com](mailto:risanbagja@gmail.com).
